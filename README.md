# Traffic-Signal-Simulation-Using-OpenGL-code-
This project, Traffic Signal Simulation Using OpenGL, is designed to visually represent a real-life traffic intersection using computer graphics. The simulation is developed using C++ and OpenGL, where traffic lights, vehicles, roads, buildings, and environmental effects are shown in an animated and interactive way.
